# Chapter 42 — The Nervous System: A Problem-Solving Machine
*How soft tissue moves information faster than diffusion should allow.*

---

Here is the puzzle this chapter is about.

You touch a hot stove. Your hand withdraws before you feel the pain. The signal travels from your fingertip to your spinal cord and back to your arm muscles in roughly fifty milliseconds — fast enough that the withdrawal is already happening before your brain registers that anything unusual occurred.

How does a cell made of the same biological material as liver and kidney cells move a signal that fast?

The speed of diffusion in biological fluids — molecules drifting through water — is measured in micrometers per second. A signal diffusing from your fingertip to your spinal cord at that rate would take years. Yet the signal makes the trip in fifty milliseconds. There is clearly a different mechanism at work. And that mechanism — the thing that makes nervous systems possible at all — is the electrical potential stored across the cell membrane.

A neuron is not a wire. It is a battery that can discharge in a controlled, directional way. Understanding how that discharge works, how it propagates, how it crosses from one cell to the next, and how thousands of inputs are integrated into a single yes-or-no decision — that is what this chapter explains.

## The Battery: Resting Membrane Potential

A neuron at rest has the inside of its membrane sitting at about -70 millivolts relative to the outside. That is not a large voltage — your household current is over a hundred times higher — but it is maintained continuously, across every square micrometer of membrane, by active molecular machinery. And it is the source of everything that follows.

Why is the inside negative?

Two mechanisms work together. The first is the sodium-potassium pump, a protein embedded in the membrane that uses ATP to move three sodium ions out of the cell for every two potassium ions it moves in. This is not passive diffusion — it runs against concentration gradients, actively pumping. Three positive charges out, two positive charges in: the pump is a net exporter of positive charge, which makes the inside more negative.

The second mechanism is selective leakage. The membrane contains many more potassium leak channels than sodium leak channels. Potassium, even though the pump has been pushing it in, leaks back out faster than sodium leaks in. More positive charge leaves than enters. The inside becomes more negative still.

The equilibrium is reached when the electrical attraction pulling potassium back in (because the inside is negative) exactly balances the concentration gradient pushing it out. At that point, about -70 mV, the system is stable. Ions are still moving — potassium leaking out, the pump pushing it back in — but the net charge across the membrane holds constant.

<!-- → [IMAGE: Diagram of a neuron membrane at rest showing two mechanisms side by side — left: sodium-potassium pump with labeled arrows showing "3 Na+ out, 2 K+ in" and "ATP consumed"; right: potassium leak channels with arrows showing K+ leaking out faster than Na+ leaks in; annotate the resulting charge: "inside: −70 mV, negative" / "outside: positive"; a small bar showing the −70 mV resting potential as a labeled voltage] -->

This is the resting potential. It is not a passive state. The cell is burning ATP continuously to maintain it. Neurons are among the most metabolically expensive cells in the body precisely because they spend so much energy holding this imbalance in place. The payoff is that the imbalance is potential energy, stored and ready to use.

## The Discharge: Action Potential

When a neuron is excited — when a signal arrives and pushes the membrane voltage upward — something happens at a threshold around -55 millivolts that is the most important event in neuroscience.

Voltage-gated sodium channels open.

These channels are different from the leak channels that maintain the resting potential. They are sensitive to voltage: when the membrane depolarizes past a certain point, the channel protein changes shape and opens. Sodium, which is in high concentration outside the cell and attracted inward by the negative interior, rushes in. The inside becomes less negative. Then positive. The voltage swings from -70 mV all the way to about +40 mV in roughly a millisecond.

But sodium channels cannot stay open. They have two gates: an activation gate that opens when voltage rises, and an inactivation gate that closes automatically a millisecond or so after opening, regardless of what the voltage is doing. The channel slams shut and enters a refractory period during which it cannot be opened again, no matter how strong the signal.

At the same time, voltage-gated potassium channels — slower to respond than sodium channels — begin to open. Potassium, which has been pushed in by the pump and is attracted out by the now-positive interior, floods out. The voltage plunges back toward negative. The potassium channels are also slower to close, so the membrane briefly overshoots the resting potential, dipping to perhaps -85 mV before the channels finally close and the pump restores normal conditions.

<!-- → [CHART: Action potential voltage trace — x-axis: time in milliseconds (0 to ~5 ms); y-axis: membrane voltage (−80 mV to +50 mV) — labeled phases: (1) resting at −70 mV; (2) threshold crossed at −55 mV; (3) depolarization rising to +40 mV as Na+ rushes in; (4) repolarization falling as Na+ channels inactivate and K+ channels open; (5) hyperpolarization dipping to −85 mV as K+ channels close slowly; (6) return to resting potential — annotate the refractory period during phases 4–5 as "no new action potential possible here"] -->

This whole sequence — depolarization, repolarization, brief hyperpolarization, return to rest — is the action potential. It is all-or-nothing. Either threshold is reached and the full cycle happens, or it does not happen at all. There is no such thing as a weak action potential. The same size spike occurs whether the stimulus was barely above threshold or far above it.

If the signal size is always the same, how does the nervous system distinguish between a gentle touch and a painful pressure? By frequency. A strong stimulus causes a neuron to fire repeatedly, many action potentials per second. A weak stimulus causes fewer. Information is encoded in the rate of firing, not in the amplitude of individual spikes.

## Propagation: How the Signal Travels

An action potential that occurs at one point on an axon does not stay there. It propagates.

When a region of membrane depolarizes, positive charge flows sideways inside the axon to the neighboring region, which was still at resting potential. This local current flow depolarizes the neighboring membrane. When that neighboring region reaches threshold, its voltage-gated sodium channels open, and it generates its own action potential. The process repeats.

But the region that just fired cannot fire again immediately — it is in its refractory period. The action potential can only propagate forward. It cannot turn around and travel backward.

In an unmyelinated axon, this works, but it is slow. The current leaks out through the membrane as it travels, and each region must regenerate the signal. The signal moves at perhaps one to two meters per second.

Myelinated axons are different. Glial cells wrap around the axon in a spiral of fatty myelin, leaving periodic bare gaps called nodes of Ranvier spaced roughly a millimeter apart. Myelin is an excellent electrical insulator. Between nodes, current cannot leak out. The depolarization travels passively down the inside of the axon with minimal loss, until it reaches the next node. At the node, which is packed with voltage-gated sodium channels, the action potential is regenerated at full strength.

<!-- → [IMAGE: Comparison diagram of unmyelinated vs. myelinated axon propagation — top panel: unmyelinated axon showing current leaking out at every point along the membrane, with the action potential regenerated continuously; bottom panel: myelinated axon showing the myelin wrapping (Schwann cells labeled) with gaps (nodes of Ranvier labeled), current confined inside between nodes, action potential jumping from node to node; annotate conduction velocities: "unmyelinated: ~1–2 m/s" vs. "myelinated: ~70–100 m/s"] -->

This is saltatory conduction: the signal appears to jump from node to node. The effect on speed is dramatic. A myelinated motor axon running from the spinal cord to the foot can transmit a signal at seventy to a hundred meters per second — fast enough to cross a meter in ten milliseconds. The same axon unmyelinated would take a second or more.

Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks myelin. As myelin degrades, saltatory conduction fails. Signals slow or stop entirely. The result is weakness, numbness, vision problems, and eventually loss of function — a clinical demonstration of how central myelin is to nervous system operation.

## Crossing the Gap: The Synapse

An action potential reaches the end of an axon. Now what?

Most axons do not physically connect to the next cell. There is a gap — the synaptic cleft, about twenty nanometers wide. Electrical current does not jump this gap effectively. Instead, the presynaptic neuron releases a chemical.

When the action potential depolarizes the axon terminal, voltage-gated calcium channels open. Calcium floods in. Calcium triggers vesicles — small membrane-bound sacs packed with neurotransmitter molecules — to fuse with the terminal membrane. Their contents spill into the synaptic cleft.

The neurotransmitter molecules diffuse across the twenty-nanometer gap in microseconds and bind to receptor proteins on the postsynaptic membrane. Depending on the receptor and the neurotransmitter, the binding opens ion channels. Some channels let sodium in (depolarizing, excitatory). Others let chloride in or potassium out (hyperpolarizing, inhibitory). The postsynaptic neuron's membrane voltage shifts.

<!-- → [IMAGE: Synaptic transmission diagram — presynaptic axon terminal on the left showing: action potential arriving, voltage-gated Ca²+ channels opening, Ca²+ entering, vesicles labeled "neurotransmitter" fusing with membrane, molecules releasing into the synaptic cleft; postsynaptic membrane on the right showing: receptor proteins with neurotransmitter molecules bound, ion channel opening, arrow indicating Na+ entering (excitatory) or Cl− entering (inhibitory); the synaptic cleft labeled with its ~20 nm width; annotate three clearance mechanisms: diffusion, enzymatic breakdown, reuptake transporter] -->

The most common excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain is glutamate. The most common inhibitory one is GABA. Acetylcholine operates at the neuromuscular junction, where motor neurons command muscle fibers, and also in parts of the brain. Dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine modulate whole circuits rather than individual synapses — they change the excitability of large populations of neurons, affecting mood, motivation, attention, and arousal.

After the signal is transmitted, the neurotransmitter must be cleared from the cleft, or it will continue binding receptors and the signal will not stop. Three mechanisms accomplish this: diffusion away from the cleft, enzymatic breakdown (enzymes in the cleft cut the neurotransmitter apart), and reuptake (transporter proteins in the presynaptic membrane pull the neurotransmitter back into the terminal for recycling).

This last mechanism — reuptake — is the target of many psychiatric drugs. Fluoxetine (Prozac) blocks serotonin reuptake transporters, so serotonin stays in the cleft longer and continues signaling. Cocaine blocks dopamine reuptake, flooding reward circuits with dopamine. The drugs work precisely because they manipulate the chemistry of synaptic transmission.

## Integration: Computing a Decision

A single neuron in the cerebral cortex receives input from thousands of other neurons simultaneously. Some inputs are excitatory, pushing the membrane toward threshold. Others are inhibitory, pushing it away. They arrive at different dendrites, at different times, with different strengths.

The axon hillock — the region where the axon joins the cell body — is where this integration occurs. It has the highest density of voltage-gated sodium channels and the lowest threshold for firing. Its voltage at any moment is the weighted sum of all the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing inputs arriving from thousands of synapses.

If enough excitatory inputs arrive at roughly the same time, the hillock reaches -55 mV and fires. The neuron fires. If inhibitory inputs dominate, the voltage stays low and the neuron remains silent.

This integration is not a simple vote. Timing matters. Two excitatory inputs arriving at the same synapse in rapid succession add their effects (temporal summation). Multiple inputs arriving simultaneously at different locations on the dendrite tree add their effects if they depolarize the hillock (spatial summation). An inhibitory input landing between an excitatory synapse and the hillock can block the excitatory current from reaching its destination.

<!-- → [IMAGE: Neuron integration diagram — a neuron with multiple dendrites shown receiving labeled inputs: several green "excitatory (EPSP)" synapses and two red "inhibitory (IPSP)" synapses at different locations; arrows showing how EPSPs and IPSPs travel toward the axon hillock; the axon hillock labeled with the threshold (−55 mV); one scenario showing "enough EPSPs → threshold reached → action potential fires" and a second showing "inhibitory input blocks current from reaching hillock → no action potential"] -->

The neuron is not a relay. It is a computing element. It collects information from a large number of inputs, weights them by timing, location, and strength, and renders a binary decision: fire or do not fire. The nervous system's computational power arises not from any individual neuron being complex but from billions of these simple decision-makers connected in intricate networks.

## Organization: From Spinal Cord to Cortex

The nervous system is not a uniform mass of neurons. It is hierarchically organized, with different structures handling different tasks on different timescales.

The spinal cord handles the fastest responses. A reflex arc can be as simple as two neurons: a sensory neuron detecting a stimulus and synapsing directly onto a motor neuron that moves the muscle. The signal never reaches the brain before the response occurs. By the time your brain registers the event, your body has already responded. The spinal cord also serves as a relay, sending sensory information upward to the brain and motor commands downward from the brain to muscles.

The brainstem sits just above the spinal cord and controls the machinery of basic survival: heart rate, breathing, blood pressure, swallowing, eye movement. It maintains consciousness and arousal. Damage to the brainstem is quickly fatal or produces a coma.

The cerebellum — the small, dense structure at the back of the brain — coordinates movement. It does not initiate actions, but it refines them. It compares what the motor cortex intended to what the body actually did, and it adjusts. A person with cerebellar damage can initiate movement but cannot produce smooth, accurate motion. Reaching for a glass becomes a series of jerky overshoots and corrections.

The thalamus is a relay station sitting at the center of the brain. Almost all sensory information passes through it on the way to the cortex. The thalamus does not just passively transmit — it filters. During sleep, the thalamus suppresses sensory signals, reducing the cortex's exposure to external input.

The hypothalamus, below the thalamus, is small but controls an enormous range of functions: body temperature, hunger, thirst, circadian rhythm, and the release of hormones from the pituitary gland. It is the brain's homeostatic regulator.

The limbic system — including the hippocampus and amygdala — processes emotion, fear, and memory. The hippocampus is essential for forming new memories. A patient known as H.M., who had his hippocampus removed surgically in 1953 to treat epilepsy, could no longer form new memories after the surgery. He could remember his life before the operation. He could learn new motor skills. But he could not remember anything that happened after the surgery for more than a few minutes. Every morning was fresh. He met the same people every day and introduced himself as if for the first time.

The amygdala processes threat and fear. Damage to the amygdala impairs the ability to recognize dangerous situations. Patients with amygdala damage may approach strangers or situations they should find threatening with no appropriate wariness.

The cerebral cortex is the outermost layer — roughly two to four millimeters thick, heavily folded to increase surface area. It is divided into four lobes. The occipital lobe processes vision. The temporal lobe processes sound and contains the hippocampus. The parietal lobe integrates touch, proprioception, and spatial awareness. The frontal lobe executes movement, plans behavior, and regulates judgment and impulse control.

<!-- → [IMAGE: Lateral view of the human brain labeled with four lobes (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital) and key subcortical structures — cerebellum at the back-bottom, brainstem at the base, and a cutaway or ghost image showing thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala in their approximate locations; annotate each region with its primary function in a short phrase] -->

The cortex is also divided functionally: regions at the back are primarily sensory, regions toward the front are primarily motor, and the prefrontal cortex — the most anterior region — is involved in planning, working memory, and executive control. Damage to the prefrontal cortex does not impair sensory processing or movement but produces striking changes in judgment and impulse control.

## Learning: Synapses That Change

Synapses are not fixed. They can strengthen or weaken based on experience. This plasticity is the physical basis of learning and memory.

The mechanism of synaptic strengthening is long-term potentiation, or LTP. It depends on a special receptor called the NMDA receptor, which responds to glutamate. The NMDA receptor is unusual in that it functions as a molecular coincidence detector: it opens only when glutamate is bound *and* the postsynaptic membrane is already depolarized. In practice, this means it opens only when a synapse is active at the same time the postsynaptic neuron is receiving strong input from other sources.

When the NMDA receptor opens, calcium enters the postsynaptic cell. The calcium triggers a cascade of molecular events that leads to more AMPA receptors (the normal glutamate receptor) being inserted into the synapse. With more receptors, the synapse becomes more effective — the same amount of glutamate from the presynaptic cell now produces a larger response. The synapse has been strengthened, potentially for hours or years.

<!-- → [IMAGE: LTP mechanism diagram — two panels: left panel (before LTP): postsynaptic membrane showing NMDA receptor with Mg²+ block in place and a small number of AMPA receptors; right panel (after LTP): Mg²+ expelled from NMDA receptor, Ca²+ entered, AMPA receptors added to the membrane ("more receptors = stronger synapse"); annotate the coincidence-detector logic: "NMDA opens only when glutamate is present AND postsynaptic membrane is depolarized simultaneously"] -->

This is the molecular basis of Hebb's principle: cells that fire together, wire together. If synapse A is consistently active when neuron B fires, synapse A becomes a strong connection between its presynaptic neuron and B. The connection encodes the correlation.

Synaptic weakening — long-term depression — is the complement. Synapses that are consistently active when nothing important is happening lose AMPA receptors. They become quieter. This pruning is as important as strengthening: learning involves not just encoding new patterns but clearing away connections that are not useful, so that the strong connections stand out clearly.

The nervous system is not a static machine. It is remodeled continuously by experience, from the molecular level up.

## What This Explains

Return to the hot stove. Your fingertip has sensory neurons with terminals in the skin, sensitive to heat and pain. When you touch the stove, these neurons depolarize, reach threshold, and fire. The signal travels along their axons toward the spinal cord — fast, because the axons are myelinated. In the spinal cord, the sensory neurons synapse onto motor neurons. Glutamate is released, the motor neurons depolarize, and they fire. Their signals travel back along myelinated motor axons to the muscles of your arm, which contract and withdraw the hand.

Simultaneously, the sensory signal propagates upward to the brain, where it will, in a fraction of a second, be processed by the thalamus and routed to the somatosensory cortex, where you will experience pain. But the withdrawal has already happened by the time you consciously register it.

Every element of what I have described in this chapter is visible in this single event. The resting potential that made the signal possible. The action potential that encoded it and propagated it. The synapse that transferred it across cellular gaps. The integration that computed a motor response. The myelination that made the timing work. The organization that divided fast reflexes from conscious experience.

The nervous system is not elegant. It is tangled, redundant, and metabolically extravagant. But it solves the problem it is built to solve: it moves information fast enough to be useful in a world that will not wait.

## Exercises

**Warm-up**

1. A neuron has a resting membrane potential of −70 mV. The sodium-potassium pump moves 3 Na⁺ out for every 2 K⁺ in, using one ATP per cycle. Explain why this asymmetric exchange (3 out, 2 in) is essential to maintaining the negative resting potential, rather than a 1:1 exchange. *Tests: understanding the net charge contribution of the pump.*

2. An action potential is described as "all-or-nothing." A student argues that this means a stronger stimulus produces a bigger action potential. Correct this misconception, and explain how the nervous system actually encodes stimulus intensity if the spike size is always the same. *Tests: distinguishing spike amplitude from firing frequency as the coding variable.*

3. A myelinated motor axon runs from the spinal cord to the foot — approximately one meter. The axon conducts at 80 m/s. Calculate how long the signal takes to travel this distance. Then calculate how long it would take in an unmyelinated axon conducting at 1 m/s. What does this difference mean for a reflex that must withdraw the foot from a sharp object? *Tests: applying conduction velocity to timing calculations and connecting to function.*

**Application**

4. The drug tetrodotoxin (TTX), found in puffer fish, blocks voltage-gated sodium channels and is lethal in small doses. Using what you know about the action potential mechanism, explain at what step TTX would block signal propagation and predict the physiological consequences of TTX poisoning. Why would blocking sodium channels be lethal rather than merely causing mild neurological symptoms? *Tests: applying action potential mechanism to predict drug effects.*

5. A person is prescribed fluoxetine (Prozac) for depression. The drug blocks serotonin reuptake transporters at synapses. Describe what happens at a serotonergic synapse in the presence of fluoxetine compared to normal. Why might increasing serotonin availability in the cleft improve mood, based on what you know about neurotransmitter function? *Tests: applying synaptic transmission mechanism to a pharmacological context.*

6. H.M.'s surgery removed his hippocampus bilaterally. After surgery, he could still remember his past, learn new motor skills (like mirror tracing), and have conversations — but could not remember any event that occurred after the surgery for more than a few minutes. What does this pattern of preserved and lost abilities tell you about the hippocampus's specific role in memory? What does it tell you about where older memories and motor skills are stored? *Tests: reasoning from a clinical case to infer functional specialization of brain regions.*

**Synthesis**

7. A neuron at the axon hillock is receiving inputs from 200 excitatory synapses and 50 inhibitory synapses simultaneously. The excitatory synapses each produce a +0.5 mV depolarization; the inhibitory synapses each produce a −1 mV hyperpolarization. Starting from the resting potential of −70 mV, calculate the net membrane voltage at the hillock and determine whether the neuron will fire (threshold: −55 mV). Then describe what would need to change — in excitatory or inhibitory input — to make the neuron fire. *Tests: applying temporal and spatial summation quantitatively.*

8. Long-term potentiation (LTP) requires the NMDA receptor to act as a coincidence detector, opening only when both glutamate is bound and the postsynaptic membrane is already depolarized. Explain why this coincidence requirement is essential for encoding specific associations (like learning that a bell predicts food) rather than simply strengthening every synapse that fires. What would go wrong with learning if NMDA receptors opened whenever glutamate was bound, regardless of postsynaptic activity? *Tests: connecting the NMDA mechanism to the functional logic of associative learning.*

**Challenge**

9. Multiple sclerosis (MS) damages myelin in the CNS. Patients often experience symptoms that come and go — a period of weakness or vision loss, followed by partial recovery, followed by relapse. Using your understanding of saltatory conduction and myelin, propose a cellular-level explanation for why MS symptoms might partially remit (improve) before eventually worsening. What structural changes at the node of Ranvier or along the axon might explain partial recovery? *Tests: reasoning about myelin function and repair to explain a clinical pattern.*

10. The nervous system uses frequency coding (rate of action potential firing) to encode stimulus intensity, yet action potentials have a refractory period that limits how fast a neuron can fire. A typical neuron can fire at most about 100–200 times per second. If a very intense stimulus needs to be encoded as "extremely strong," propose two mechanisms the nervous system might use to communicate intensity beyond the firing rate limit of a single neuron. Connect your answer to what you know about neural circuits and population coding. *Tests: reasoning beyond single-neuron mechanisms to circuit-level solutions for a coding problem.*
